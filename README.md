# Decentralised Art Marketplace with Royalty Tracking

Problem Statement:

The traditional art market is dogged by a host of problems, including:
It's hard to track and pay royalties to the creators.
High transaction fees characterize the conventional sales of art.
Inadequate transparency makes it hard to prove the authenticity of a work.

Proposed Solution:

As such, this project proposes an Ethereum blockchain-backed decentralized art marketplace for these very problems.
NFT Minting: Artists can mint their artwork into NFTs, which are basically unique digital ownership certificates.
Smart Contract Management: Smart contracts within this blockchain track ownership and royalty percentage for each NFT.
Royalty Payments: In the case of resale of an NFT, a predefined portion of the sale price is instantly transferred back to the creator as royalties.
Decentralized Storage: Filecoin, a decentralized storage network, stores High-resolution image files of the artwork and metadata securely.

Tech Stack:

Blockchain Platform: Ethereum(Rinkeby Testnet)
Smart Contract Language: Solidity
Development Environment: Remix IDE
Wallet: MetaMask
Decentralized Storage: Filecoin Stack (web3.storage)
Frontend Library: Web3.js

Social Features:

Artist Following: Follow artists to keep track of the latest creations from each one.
NFT Collections: Create collections of favorite NFTs.
Comments and Ratings: Commenting and rating on NFTs helps in creating a community regarding the art.

It has the following benefits as a decentralized art marketplace:

Transparency and Security: Blockchain ensures that all transactions related to ownership and royalty payments are secure and transparent.
Reduced Fees: Transaction fees are way cheaper compared to traditional sale fees for art.
Artist Empowerment: Gives artists a platform where they can exhibit their work directly to collectors and get proper royalties for their work.
Community Building: Equipped with social features building a community of art lovers.
